<h2>Why did I become interested in computers and programming?</h2>
<p>I became interested in computers at a very young age. I am disabled so computers were something I was able to fully enjoy without being physically restricted.</p>
<p>I started getting into programming more recently because I had always been passionate about computer hardware but felt like I was missing out on so much more.</p>

<h2>What is my dream goal?</h2>
<p>I've always been really interested in music, especially the songs that make up the Great American Songbook. Before the pandemic I even performed this music at a variety of different venues, so my biggest dream in life would be to perform jazz standards full-time. Unrelated, but also meeting Linus Torvalds would be pretty cool.</p>

<h2>My favorite Wikipedia page.</h2>
<p> I really enjoy learning about history, so my favorite Wikipedia page has to do with one of my favorite historical figures, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_the_Great" target="_blank">Alfred I.</a></p>
