<h1>The Founding</h1>
<p>The Peasant Republic of Hamarschen was founded in the year 1121 A.D. as a safe haven for peasants, merchants, and artisans from the tyrannical Price-Electorate of Saxony.
The town was established within a vast forest as to be hidden from the authority of Saxony. Due to its isolation within the dense Saxon forest, the climate of Hamarschen is unusually colder compared to the rest of the region.
20 years after its founding, the Holy Roman Emperoir granted Hamarschen free-city status, granting it elevated autonomy from imperial decree.</p>
 <h1>System of Governance</h1>
 <p>The City of Hamarschen was established as a peasant republic, so the power of governance lies with the people of the city. Anyone is able to participate in the Hamarschen council so long as they hold land within the city.
 The more land one holds, the more power their vote has.</p>
 <h1>Hamarschen Today</h1>
 <p>Today in the year 1180, Hamarschen is a quiant trading village of roughly 100 people. The town hosts a variety of tourist spots, which you can find out more about on the attractions page. The town lacks much infrastructure due to its small size,
  and only has one dirt path connecting it to the rest of the empire. The medieval era also means pollution is an ongoing issue, since residents discard their waste buckets in the street and let farm animals roam freely. Since its inception, the town 
  has had an issue with bandits and looters using it as a hideout from Saxon and Imperial authorities.</p>
