<h2><b>What do I hope to get out of IT1150?</b></h2>
<p>I hope to get a better understanding of front-end development, and whether or not it is something that I would enjoy doing as a career.</p>

<h2><b>Why did I become interested in computers and programming?</b></h2>
<p>I became interested in computers at a very young age. I am disabled so computers were something I was able to fully enjoy without being physically restricted.</p>
<p>I started getting into programming more recently because I had always been passionate about computer hardware but felt like I was missing out on so much more.</p>

<h2><b>What are my goals for after graduation?</b></h2>
<p>After graduation I plan on transferring to a 4-year institute in order to pursue a Bachelors in computer science.</p>

<h2><b>What is my dream goal?</b></h2>
<p>I've always been really interested in music, especially the songs that make up the Great American Songbook. Before the pandemic I even performed this music at a variety of different venues,</p>
<p>so my biggest dream in life would be to perform jazz standards full-time. Unrelated, but also meeting Linus Torvalds would be pretty cool.</p>

<h2><b>My favorite Wikipedia page.</b></h2>
<p> I really enjoy learning about history, so my favorite Wikipedia page has to do with one of my favorite historical figures, Alfred I.</p>
